# optimization
instances of FunctionG are evaluated by a genetic algorithm


instances of the EvaluationFunction interface are evaluated by
either hillClimbing or a version of hybridisedSimulatedAnnealing

all the test functions are multimodal and as such,some runs might be(or not) more
successful than the others

best results for hillClimbing(HC) and simulatedAnnealing(SA)
for the 30 dimensional versions of DeJong1,Schwefel,Rastrigin
and Michalewicz
