# optimization
in the main branch instances of FunctionG are evaluated by a genetic algorithm

in the heuristic approach
the findMinimum function takes an instance of the EvaluationFunction interface 
and attemps the same purpose

all the test functions are multimodal and such,some runs might(or not) be more
successful than the others
