choices of population size, crossover rates and mutation rate are highly influential on each numerical function;

functions optima : DeJong1(0),Schwefel(-12569.487),Rastrigin(0) and Michalewicz(-28.9) (30dimensional versions).

upon further testing, with bigger population sizes and generations for the genetic algorithm (200, 1050 respectively) Schewfel's function was minimized to -12460, Michalewicz to -28 and Rastrigin to 3.26048 * 10^-6, but in comparatively more time: 10 minutes vs 2/3 minutes.
